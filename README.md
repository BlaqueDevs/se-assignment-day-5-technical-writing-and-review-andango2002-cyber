# SE-DAY5-Technical-Writing
## 1. How can understanding your audienceâ€™s expertise level (tech experts vs. regular folks) shape the way you present technical information?
Tech Experts:
They appreciate precision, depth, and technical jargon.
Focus on detailed explanations, algorithms, code snippets, and performance metrics.
Assume a baseline understanding of technical concepts.
Regular Folks:
They need clear, concise explanations in plain language.
Focus on the benefits and practical applications of the technology.
Avoid jargon and use analogies and examples to illustrate concepts.
Emphasize the "what" and "why" rather than the "how."
